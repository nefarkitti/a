        im writing this really quickly right now beacuse i just saw the craziest thing ever we got that damn email about what we're
        meant to do here right and we were getting to work and these guards ?? or soemthing came to make sure we're actually doing it ig but 
        we follow the direcdtions in the emaila nd find this whole like lab and a wall of what i can only describe as flesh? to be hoenst
        not the strangest thing i saw working here but we started following the instructions in the email and got that whole stuff done
        BUT THATS NOT THE BAD PART i woke up in the dead of night after work feeling so tired so i look over at my phone and in the corner of my 
        eye i can see my door open and my coworker is there just smiling at me?? i tried to adjust my eyes making sure i was seeing clearly and suddenly
        the doorway was just empty still open but empty and even as im writing this i have no god damn idea what just happened im gonna make sure to mention this tomorrow
        because im 100% sure it was a coworker and hte silhouette suggested it was johanness but im too tired to do anhything right now but im too scared to sleep
        now maybe ill just read we still have internet access so
