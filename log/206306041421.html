        Everybody else saw Johannes last night, but the security footage provided us by the guards around didn't show anyone being anywhere near
        our quarters. What makes it even weirder is that Johannes was asleep in his bed the entire time. He's denied it, too, despite the three of us
        being convinced that we saw him. Great. That's definitely what we needed now. Distrust. Sure we got on with our research for the day (I write this
        during my break) but I can feel the tension in the air. Everyone's so on edge. I don't blame them, I'm scared as hell too. <br><br>
        But we have to continue the work. From the way the email was worded, and how this entire thing was setup, it seems too serious to let theoretical "visions"
        hinder our research. I just hope something like that doesn't happen again. I hope that was just some weird homesickness thing I don't know. It doesn't help
        that Johannes seems to be the one most eager to work on the flesh wall. Couldn't come up with a more creative name so we're all just referring to it as "flesh wall".
        <br> <br>
        Didn't write much today. Work is already getting repetitive, there's nothing interesting coming up. I tried to be more specific about it but the whole thing got censored, the damn security software
        scans all of this stuff. <br><br>

        What I can talk about, however, ignoring all that Johannes stuff, is that this is one really weird thing they have us working on. I mean, it's literally
        just a wall of flesh? Live flesh? It seems to be alive, though I can't share more as it'd get censored anyway. Even in our own personal notes. Who the hell
        do they think we are? They don't actually have any trust in us, we're just doing their job for them. Whatever. The pay is good. I'll write mundane notes
        on as many walls of flesh as they ask me to as long as I get that pay at the end. How the hell did they even find this?
