        I got a new job recently. For the most part it's fine, but just yesterday my team (of around 4 people including me, it's small but nice) was assigned to 
        a project that's to be kept "under wraps"?
        That's the way they worded it, they had us sign NDA's and everything before being moved to an entirely new location. Thankfully they let us keep
        our computers, but they said that there'd be specialised software installed to ensure we're not sharing anything. I hope these notes don't cause
        any trouble, as I'd much prefer to write about what's happening when I'm gone for so long. <br> <br>

        I know for sure that we're somewhere deep underground, as even though we were transported in windowless cars I could feel the car rotate and my ears popped
        at a certain point in the journey. <br> <br>
        
        Currently, I'm writing this log in the new office that we were
        put in, there's a bunch of big boxes strewn about so they definitely did not finish unpacking everything before bringing us here. They gave us a tour
        of our new living quarters, the dining area and our main office where we'll be working. The living quarters aren't anything to brag about, each room was 
        a simple white square with a mattress, cover and a pillow. It felt like we were put in isolation. The whiteness of the lights, the flat walls and everything
        around feels way more clinical than our previous coloured, textured working space. Even the dining area wasn't all that comforting, just four dispensers
        against the wall accompanied by a singular big table in the middle. We were then taken to our work stations, which brings us to now. <br> <br>

        The people that brought us here just left, and the last thing told us before leaving was that we'd get an email explaining the specifics of the work we'll be doing here in one or two days, and
        that we're to get ourselves used to this new place. So I'll go and explore more by myself. I'll write more when we finally get the email, but I'll
        still try to write smaller notes about any interesting things I discover.
