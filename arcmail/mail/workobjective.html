        05/04/2063 21:02 PM | Work Objective | From Dr. ███████<br><br>

        We deemed that this department would be best suited for our current ongoing research project, and we'd like to firstly thank you for volunteering
        to assist us. <br><br>

        We hope that the modifications to your systems aren't too invasive or problematic, they're only there to protect everyone's privacy and security. We don't
        want the press snooping around now, do we? <br><br>

        We also hope that your new "permanent" accomodation is suitable enough for you. The guards that will be present are your best way of
        contacting us with any complaints, as we will not be letting you send emails to us. <br><br>

        Your objective is to study the object of interest within the laboratory that can be found to your right when leaving your office area. You will spend all of
        your time here until we deem your research on the object of interest adequately in-depth. We're leaving this to you because we have trust that you will
        provide us with the answers that we need. <br><br>

        We thank you for your time. <br>
        Dr. ███████
