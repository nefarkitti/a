        does not dispense non-foods (tried bricks) <br>
        everything dispenses as a liquid like those baby drinks, even entire meals like pizza <br>
        there are no utensils whatsoever but that's probably because we just drink it anyway <br>
        bowl provided on every dispense, won't dispense at all if missing (sorry lewis)<br>
        after dispensing food, hasn't let us dispense again so far probably only for specific times like lunch and dinner
